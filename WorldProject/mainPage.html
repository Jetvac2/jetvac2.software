      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Delhi, Ibn Battuta signed a contract with the sultan to be employed as a Qadi, or judge. He bestowed gifts upon the sultan for this employment, including arrows, camels, slaves, horses (around 30) and several other items of interest. He stayed in Delhi for 7 years as Qadi, but eventually left for China in 1341. While he was a judge, he visited Qutub Minar, a part of the Qutub complex that serves as a victory tower of sorts. Ibn himself said that the tower “has no parallel in the lands of Islam.” Also while Ibn was in Delhi he got married and had a doughter he also tried to give to the poor to aid them in the famine.

        <p> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia is primarily Muslim, with 63.5% of the 33 million people there following the religion. This may have been caused by traders from Islam taking over the Malaysian area in the early 1300s. Before Islam, Malaysia was primarily Buddhist. Ibn Battuta was vague about his visit here, but he used it as a passage by boat to Quanzhou. It is also the farthest east that Islam has spread, making it the last place he felt comfortable in. After Muslim traders started taxing those who passed through Malaysia’s strait, Christopher Colombus was sent out to try and find a different route for travel, resulting in the discovery of North and South America.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Ibn Battuta did not say a lot about Guangzhou, he did have some strong opinions on China as a whole. Although he stated that China pleased him, he said that he was “greatly troubled about the way paganism dominated this country”, referring to China’s primarily Buddhist religion, and when he did see Muslims, he said that he felt like he was “meeting my own family and kinsmen”. He also called the Chinese “infidels” and stated that they “eat the flesh of swine and dogs, and sell it in their markets.” However, Battuta did feel the final moments of peace during the Yuan dynasty, and wrote that “China is the safest and most agreeable country in the world for the traveler.”

      <p> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ibn Battuta took a trip along the Grand Canal to reach Beijing… maybe. Some historians argue that due to how vague his recap of his travels were. Originally, he was supposed to bring gifts from Delhi to the capital of Mongol China, which was Beijing at the time, but he shipwrecked in Quanzhou and lost his gifts for the emperor. He also sought to reach the “edge of the known world” with his travels to China and Beijing especially.
